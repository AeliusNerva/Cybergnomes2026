    1. Get accurate gyro inputs
    2. Simple trig for driving
    3. Modulate for rotation

## Shoot balls accurately at targets
- Figure out exact relative position of robot and hub means find exact relative position of robot and april tag, convert to world and subtract hub from world
- Also get delta velocity of hub and robot
- Convert to velocity vector to shoot ball
- Convert into turret pitch, yaw, and ball acceleration
